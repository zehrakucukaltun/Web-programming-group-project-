               <h4>The Korowai Tribe</h4>
               <p> Papua New Guinea is one of the countries in the world where it is no secret cannibalism has been practiced in the past, and up until quite recently. The Korowai tribe is one of the last known tribes in the world to have been cannibals. Because of the Korowai belief in evil spirits, it was necessary to kill and eat a person they believed had been taken over by a “khakua”, or demon.
                 There is talk that the practice is still carried out today, and some members of the tribe will state this. However others believe this claim is just for a good story to live up to the expectations by foreigners. Either way, the tribe still has a recent history of cannibalism.

               <p>MANILA — Manila North Cemetery, opened in 1904, is one of the oldest and largest in the Philippines. Its elaborate mausoleums and endless rows of humble, stacked tombs are home to an estimated one million of the dead — and a few thousand of the living.
                 The final resting place of presidents, movie stars and literary icons, the cemetery is also inhabited by some of Manila’s poorest people. Many live in the crypts and mausoleums of wealthy families, who pay them a stipend to clean and watch over them.

               <p>Green's thriftiness was legendary. She was said never to turn on the heat or use hot water. She wore one old black dress and undergarments that she changed only after they had been worn out; she did not wash her hands and she rode in an old carriage. She ate mostly pies that cost fifteen cents. One tale claims that Green spent half a night searching her carriage for a lost stamp worth two cents. Another asserts that she instructed her laundress to wash only the dirtiest parts of her dresses (the hems) to save money on soap</p>

               <h4>The man who hasn't lowered his arm since 1973</h4>

               <p>A Standing Baba, or Khareshwari, is a Hindu who has vowed to stand, not sitting or lying down even to sleep. The vow is a form of Hindu Tapa (or Tapasas), a self-inflicted corporal punishment intended to help bring spiritual enlightenment. Khareshwari are primarily found in India, but are not limited to that country.
                 The length of the vow is unclear from available references. One source says that the vow lasts for twelve years. Other sources do not attach a specific time frame.
                 Khareshwari traditionally stood under a tree. This may be connected to the Yoga position known as Vrikasana, the Tree Position. A seventeenth-century engraving shows some images of what may be Standing Baba.
                 More recently Khareshwari seem to stand inside. Author Gregory David Roberts places Babas inside in his description of Khareshwari in the novel Shantaram.</p>

       <h4>Shoebill</h4>
       <p>The shoebill stork has, well ... a bill shaped like a shoe.
         Also of note about this amazing animal? Shoebills are abnormally tall, with some individuals reaching heights of over 4 feet. And, unlike many others birds who inhabit similar marsh environments, shoebills are highly effective predators. Their long legs are perfect for traversing shallow waters, where they prey on reptiles, rodents and fish. They are even known to strike against juvenile crocodiles!
         Shoebills use their powerful beaks to grasp and strangle just about anything they encounter, but don’t worry – they don’t prey on humans. Find one in East Africa, where their habitat is concentrated.</p>

       <h4>Glass Frog</h4>
       <p>Just as you can see through glass, you can see through the extraordinary glass frog. Many of these frogs have lime-green skin, but some lack any coloration on their underside, making their organs visible to the naked eye. Equally amazing are their spotted backs, which scientists speculate are meant to resemble eggs – so predators going after their offspring get confused.
         Your best chance of spotting this tree-dwelling frog is in Costa Rica or Panama. Costa Rica's Tortuguero National Park in particular promises a good chance of seeing one, in all its transparent glory.</p>

        <h4>Mantis shrimp </h4>
       <p>Mantis shrimp are ancient, fierce and more than a little weird. Various forms of mantis shrimp have been around for an estimated 400 million years, and they aren’t like any other shrimp around. They are so freakishly strong that their appendages, called “clubs,” can smash crab shells and bust open clams. (Some varieties have spears rather than clubs, which are equally formidable.)
         These clubs can also be used to dish out around 500 punches in under a second, delivering enough force to break glass.
         And that's not all. Because these shrimp have incredible eyesight (they can see in two different directions at once), they strike with pinpoint accuracy.
         There are about 400 different species of mantis shrimp, the most dazzling-looking of which is undoubtedly the multi-hued peacock mantis shrimp, pictured here.
         The waters of Costa Rica and Bali are particularly rich with mantis shrimp; book a diving expedition to see one up close.</p>

       <p>The axolotl salamander manages to be at once adorable and kind of disturbing. Though it develops legs, it never reaches land, instead spending its time strolling the underwater surface. Its nickname ? Walking fish. They are characterized by a unique set of external gills along with the ability to completely regrow lost limbs.
         This extraordinary creature – which comes in colors ranging from creamy white to olive – is only native to Mexico. Your best chance of seeing one exists near Mexico City in the lakes of Xochimilco.
         A population decline is largely attributed to habitat loss, but is also due to the fact that the axolotl is considered a culinary delicacy. (Yum?)</p>

        <h4>Sea pen</h4>
       <p>Invertebrates that anchor on the seafloor are not uncommon, but sea pens possess a few standout features. For one thing, they look like an old-fashioned quill pen. For another, they behave in a completely remarkable way.
         Sea pens colonize in groups and, when stimulated, light up, displaying a bright green light on the seafloor. It looks like someone flipped on a light switch, especially when groups emit light in sequence.
         You can find these light displays in the Pacific Ocean, from the Gulf of Alaska to California. Sea pens live at depths of over 40 feet but often under 250 feet. When diving, look for mud and sandy-bottom sections of the ocean floor to spot them.</p>

     <h4>Panda ant</h4>
       <p>Just as panda bears are notoriously cute, so too are panda ants. Fuzzy, with a white body and black spots, they look adorable and innocent. But don’t underestimate them, as they might actually be more dangerous than the bears.
         Panda ants are found in Chile and Argentina, and the females are actually wingless wasps. This means they pack a serious punch with their sting.
         So if you see a cute little ant that looks like a panda in Chile or Argentina, whatever you do, don’t pick it up.</p>

       <h4>Narwahl</h4>
       <p>Oh, the mythical-looking narwhal! This is the closest creature (so far) that has similar features of the beloved unicorn. Unfortunately, these guys aren't easy to find either.
         They live in the Canadian Arctic, swimming throughout the Greenlandic and Russian waters. These creatures can live up to 50 years, with their main cause of death being suffocation — due to being trapped by sea ice. Like their other whale counterparts, they are quite large, ranging from 13 to 18 feet (excluding the tusk).
         They do not have a dorsal fin, but their impressive tusk can be as large as 10 feet. Male narwhals are typically the ones to grow a tusk, which is actually a canine tooth that comes from the left side of the upper jaw through the lip. Some males (about one in 500) have two tusks, while only about 15 percent of females tout the unusual trait.</p>

       <p>The kinkajou is the only known tree-dwelling mammal unrelated to primates. Growing to about two feet in length and tipping the scales at just 10 pounds, these small mammals make their homes in forests from the Yucatan to the Amazon. Kinkajou use a prehensile tail to access and devour fruit high in the forest canopy. They are most active at night and can occasionally be spotted descending on rainforest resort patios like the one seen here at Sweet Songs Jungle Lodge in Belize.</p>

In the 1980s, geologists who excavated in this region to obtain gas went very deep and caused methane gas to rise to the surface. The geologists left the area out of fear without even getting their equipment. After these events, the authorities decided to burn the reserve so that the methane gas would not poison the people in the region. The reserve has been burning non-stop ever since.</p>

                          <p>Ney Cave is located about 6 km from the center of Guilin city in northwest China. It is a magnificent cave where one can witness the magnificent beauty of the long past of the world. Limestone formations, stalactites and stalagmites, different rock shapes in the limestone cave, which is 180 million years old and 240 meters deep, make the cave fascinating with the colorful lighting of the inside of the cave. The cave, which was unknown until 1940, was rediscovered after the refugees escaping from Japanese unions during the First World War and took refuge in this cave and today it has become one of the most tourist attractions in the Guilin region. Opened to the public in 1962, Reed Flute Cave is also known as the natural arts palace. What makes this place world famous is its unique structure and colorful enlightenment. The name of the cave was given due to the similarity of the stalactites to the flute, which is a musical instrument.

This karst plateau, which emerged as horizontal and vertical geological formations as a result of millions of years of erosions, consists of rocky cliffs and caves with a very sharp and pointed surface like needle tips. The word 'Tsingy', which is its underground name, means 'place that cannot be walked barefoot' in Madagascar language. This interesting region consisting of large and pointed rocks, canyons and caves is registered as a UNESCO World Heritage. This strange forest of limestone covers an area of 666 km long, thin. There are very rare animal species in this geographical region. White lemurs are one of the rare species you can see in the region.

The reason why the nearly 400 pine trees in this forest in the town of Nowe Czarnowo in the northwestern part of Poland grow curved after some of their trunks, with a 90 degree twist, is still unknown. According to local residents, the trees begin to bend indefinitely after the age of 10. The mystery of the Crooked Forest, which has been the subject of many studies, is still not resolved. In the investigations carried out in 1930, it was determined that trees could not be transformed by either a human or a machine factor.</p>
